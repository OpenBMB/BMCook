# Installation

## 安装方法

To use BMCook, first install BMTrain.

### 1. From PyPI (Recommend)

```shell
$ pip install bmtrain
```

### 2. From Source

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTrain.git
$ cd BMTrain
$ python3 setup.py install
```

Please refer to [the installation guide](https://bmtrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of BMTrain for more details.

Then, clone the repository from our github page (don’t forget to star us!)


```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:OpenBMB/BMCook.git
```

In the future, we will support installation from PyPI and provide a one-line model compression API.
